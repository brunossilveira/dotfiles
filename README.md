# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. Use at your own risk :)

## Installation

Run the full installation:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Development & Debugging

For debugging the installation process, you can use bash debug flags:

```bash
# Run with verbose output to see all commands being executed
bash -x install.sh

# Run with additional debugging
bash -xv install.sh
```

The installation is idempotent - you can re-run it safely without issues.
