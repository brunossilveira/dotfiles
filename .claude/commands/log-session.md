description: Summarize the conversation and log it to daily work notes

Review our entire conversation and create a concise summary in the following format:

**Tags:** #tag1, #tag2, #tag3 (relevant topic tags like #nvim, #git, #dotfiles, #debugging, #refactoring, etc.)

**Summary:** (3-5 sentences covering the main questions asked, key problems solved, and important outcomes/decisions)

Then use the Bash tool to execute this command to log it to my daily Obsidian work notes:

```bash
echo 'YOUR_SUMMARY_HERE' | /Users/bruno/.config/scripts/claude-session-log.sh
```

Replace YOUR_SUMMARY_HERE with the complete formatted summary (including tags and summary text). Make sure to properly escape any quotes or special characters in the summary.
